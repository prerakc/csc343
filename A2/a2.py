    The difference between two customers c1 anc c2 is determined as follows:
    For each pair of ratings by the two customers on the same item, we compute
    the difference between ratings. The overall difference between two customers
    is the average of these ratings differences.

    Preconditions:
    - ratings.get_all_ratings(cust_id) is not None
      That is, cust_id is in the ratings table.
    - For all cid in curator_ids, ratings.get_all_ratings(cid) is not None
      That is, all the curators are in the ratings table.
